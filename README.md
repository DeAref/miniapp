2. client sends a request to Telegram servers and receives the signed data.
3. client sends the user information along with the received signatures to the web app.
4. web app sends the signed data to the bot servers.
5. bot servers have the token with them.
6. Using the token, they decode this data and send the requested information to the webapp according to the chatID.
7. web app receives this data and displays it to the user.

## how to use
- set your bot token in `back.php` 
- If you want to change the path of the `back.php` file, you must also change the api path in `miniapp.js` line `308`
- in `back.php` you can return whatever you want
